/**
 * Game 2048 AI, implements with javascript.
 *
 * Game rule:
 * The main idea of the game is that you have a 4Ã—4 grid with Integer values,
 * all of which are powers of 2. Zero valued cells are considered empty.
 * At every point during the game you are able to move the values towards 4
 * directions Up, Down, Right or Left. When you perform a move all the values
 * of the grid move towards that direction and they stop either when they reach
 * the borders of the grid or when they reach another cell with non-zero value.
 * If that previous cell has the same value, the two cells are merged into one
 * cell with double value. At the end of every move a random value is added in
 * the board in one of the empty cells and its value is either 2 with 0.9 probability
 * or 4 with 0.1 probability. The game ends when the player manages to create a cell
 * with value 2048 (win) or when there are no other moves to make (lose).
 *
 *
 * Every tile may be in three kinds of state: old, new, and merged.
